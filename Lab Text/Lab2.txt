Do the following for the Lab for this week
1.Follow the remaining slides step by step to create a web application
2.Copy your HTML pages from week 1 into the web folder
	• Redploy and make sure you can open your web pages from the browser
3.Figure out how you can change the application context in the browser URL
	• Right now, it’s pretty ugly (e.g., FirstWebApp_war_exploded)
	• There is an IntelliJ setting in the Run configuration
4.Commit and push all of your work to a ‘week2’ branch on github.com

You should be able to accomplish this all in class

Make sure to do it in class since I’m sure you will run into some issues and we can resolve them as they come up!
